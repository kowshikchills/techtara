Welcome to Tech Tara community! Its your space to explore what you need, share what you have and support many others like you. Being a member of this community is to count you in building our network for encouraging women participation in tech roles. Though we have 30â€“35% of graduates in science and tech, minor percent of them are getting into actual jobs and research related to their area of study.
We have observed a gap where many aspiring girls and women are pushing their limits to get into technical roles, but due to some reasons they are unable to achieve it. This is a platform to bridge the gap and guide them to be successful. You can become a role model to the ones seeking inspiration or you can find many role models.
We would like your participation in sharing your journeys, roadblocks and most importantly you determination that could inspire
