Intention to write this series of blogs to introduce game theory to readers at an introductory level without requiring any prior knowledge in advanced mathematics. 

Also readers find applications of game theory in their own field by understanding its applications in other field like diplomacy, economics, trading and conflict handling. This series of blogs explain common applications with assumption that reader has no prior knowledge of these fileds.

Decision problems confront us every day, We play games of strategy all the time, with parents, friends and even contenders. Some games involve trivial decisions and other are serious, some have insignificant consequences and some have serious repercussions. 
We have instinctive expertise over these decision makings, but the need for formalising these decision making process in contention and creating a language for this strategic thinking is served by game theorists.

Every field in involves decision making, strategic thinking at some level, let it be war, diplomacy, finance, economics, trading and even rent split among room mates. Game theory provides a general concepts and techniques of analysis to help decision making.

Let's start with formalising some terms we commonly use, but have subtly different meaning in the game theoretic approach.
Game theory is the analysis, or science, if you like, of such interactive decision making. Provide some general principles for thinking about strategic interactions. Strategic thinking is about interacting with similar player thinking similarly in similar situation. As we must take into account what the other player is thinking, opponent is also taking into account what we are thinking.

Now it might seems to the reader that psychological aspects are involved in this game theatric treatment, now we are going to introduce term which is more than adequately used in psychology: Rational Behaviour. You are said to be behaving rationally, if you are choosing your actions in a way to do the best according to you own criteria, given your objectives or preferences and of any limitations or constraints on your actions.

#### To combine all the terms we just learned: 

Game theory provide some general principles for thinking about strategic interactions in order to behave rationally
Let’s discuss few examples, these cases helps motivate the development of many conceptual or theoretical framework of game theory and also offers a concrete and memorable vehicle for the underlying concepts.

we can call these examples as strategic games, because of the involvement of strategic thinking amongst player. lets just try to draw a distinction between strategic games and Just games. Strategic game involves interactions between mutually aware players and decisions for action of each person depends on the actions taken by the contender and cross-effects derived from these actions taken by the contender and himself. 

It is this mutual awareness of the cross-effects of actions and the actions taken as a result of this awareness that constitute the most interesting aspects of strategy. we see lot of these trivial games actually translate into interesting applications in weightier matters like war truce, diplomatics standoff’s, economic behaviours etc. 

There are different types of games which involves non-indentical underlying principles to help player think rationally, we will discuss more about this classification of games in finer detail in the coming blogs

## Example 1: Guess 2/3 of the Average

Game where several people guess what 2/3 of the average of their guesses will be, and where the numbers are restricted to the real numbers between 0 and 100, inclusive. The winner is the one closest to the 2/3 average.

> Alain Ledoux is the founding father of the guess 2/3 of the average-game. In 1981, Ledoux used this game as a tie breaker in his French magazine Jeux et Stratégie. He asked about 4,000 readers, who reached the same number of points in previous puzzles.

## Example 2: Keynesian beauty contest

Game in which entrants are asked to choose the six most attractive faces from a hundred photographs. Those who picked the most popular faces are then eligible for a prize.

> Concept developed by John Maynard Keynes and introduced in Chapter 12 of his work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936), to explain price fluctuations in equity markets.

These are two popular examples which are used by academia to explain the concepts of game theory. Readers are encouraged to find out the answer for these two cases described above. Please note that it's not only about what you think the answer is, its also about what other contenders think the answer is.

> Consider example 2: “It is not a case of choosing those faces that, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those that average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.” (Keynes, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, 1936)

In the next blog, we state some basic concepts and terminology —provide a set of tools that will lend structure to the way in which we think about decision problems. While laying this theoretical framework, it is inevitable for us to lay down Assumptions about the behaviour of decision makers or players.
