#### First Revolution Against Imperial Enterprise


## Introduction

Events like military coups, revolutions dominate the list of events that shaped the ideas, politics and even borders of nations we live in today. American revolution stands one of the earliest but not deadliest revolutions in this list of events. It is one of the most important episode in our modern age and it sparked the fire of revolution in many other countries like France, Spain and in countries in Latin America. Let’s understand the chain of events and nature of British rule which led to the outbreak of mother of all revolutions.

## Beginning

British emigration to America started in early 17th century and slowly managed to colonise the eastern lands of America by the mid of 18th century. The violent hostility towards the native Americans by British colonial masters caused the overwhelming decline of native population in America. British nationals dominate the colonialists in America but French, Spain and Portuguese were also involved in this imperial dominance. French colonialists occupied the north of America and present Canada.

As the time progressed, one peculiar character which was observed amongst the British colonial population, was their lack of uncompromising allegiance towards mother land Britain. It must be noted that the American emigration from Britain didn’t happen for the sole reason of colonial leverage. Many migrated to America from Britain because of economic compulsions or to avoid punishments. What led to creation of typical American identity among these emigrants was British’s cold eye to its diaspora in American lands, who had to work really hard for generations to fight the native people, coercive mother nature and start agriculture activity.

American colonies were under British rule and the nature of rule was less exploitive till America’s significant advance in industrial production, which was against the British’s economic policy of mercantilism. Thus Americans also accepted the British sovereignty till industrial revolution in late 18th century. There was also one more dimension to British’s nominal rule in America, British doesn't want to impose rigid colonial rules in America as it can invoke French hostility from its colonies in Canada and further weaken already confrontational Anglo-French relations.

## Outbreak

By middle of 18th century the level of development in American colonies is no less than England. The plantation industry is flourishing, trade and commerce fueled by advanced iron and steel industry were competing with Britain and other powerful European nations. America truly embraced the Industrial revolution and not dependent on any European super powers. Politico-administrative and legal institutions were also established in America with British representation at top level .

All 13 colonies in America have their own legislatures. A different cultural thinking and institutions were developed, a typical progressive and liberal culture had evolved in America. This can be seen as a direct consequence of ideas of enlightenment. Thinkers and writers like Benjamin Franklin propounded these ideas amongst American populace.

British nominal rule and flexible execution of navigation acts (which are enacted to control the trade) were no longer agreeable to the British Industrialists and seen as a compromise of British’s mercantile economic policy. Hence British’s nominal rule hitherto, now transformed into absolute rule. In 1750, the British government imposed a number of restrictions on American industries and trade to avoid direct competition with British goods. Till 1763, Americans though obnoxious to this rigid governance, they choose not to confront British as they are apprehensive of French invasion from north.

This rigid rule from 1750 by British invited an obvious war from the French Canada. This war is called war of seven years(1756–1763). British emerged victorious, Paris treaty was signed and sovereignty over Canada is transformed to British. The change in character of British rule after the French defeat lit the fuel of American discontent and led to the outbreak of American Revolution. The cost of this war is very high and British imposed the burden of war on American colonies. British enacted a number of new laws and slapped exorbitant taxes on American populace. Sugar act, Currency act, Stamp act were some of the laws which are of exploitative nature. These rigid and exploitive laws stirred the American’s and invited their hostility.

Absence of fear of French invasion from the north also created an opportunity for the Americans to follow the path of mutiny. The voice against the rigid colonial and imperial enterprise was getting stronger. Revolution seems more imminent than ever before.
> # No Taxation without Representation — James Otis

The enlightened Americans questioned the British taxations on American lands as Americans were not represented in British legislature. In this political turmoil, British parliament enacted “Tea Policy” to help the financially troubled East India Company. This policy allows dumping of tea products into the America and this law is against the American interests. When first fleet of ships exporting tea reached Boston port, a group of Americans dumped the tea bags into the river. This incident is known as ***Boston Tea Party,*** this further intensified the American hostility towards imperial regime.

This mutual hostility continued till 1776, when large number British soldiers started landing on American soil. The alarmed Americans, proclaimed independence on 4th July, 1776 in the second American continental congress and made this immigrant war official. French immediately declared its support for Americans, French trained American soldiers and also spent a fortune in this war. Largely because of the French support, the American continental army led by general George Washington emerged victorious in the war. in 1783, peace treaty was signed in Paris to facilitate the transfer of sovereignty from British to America and America was declared independent.

## Aftermath

This revolution resulted in the independence of American colonies. All 13 colonies came together to form American Union or USA as an independent sovereign state. The first written constitution came into existence, the rights of citizens became more articulated than ever before when the American parliament adopted the bill of rights in 1789.

A liberal and progressive political systems came into existence which is based on the philosophy of capitalism. The American revolution can be seen not just a war against Imperial enterprise, it can be seen as a war against mercantilism. This revolution popularised the ideas of **liberty, equality** and **fraternity** through out the world, this lit the fire of revolution in many other countries like France, Spain and in countries in Latin America. Thinkers, writers around the world started fearlessly propounding the need for democratic institutions and practices. Decolonisation can also be seen as one of the important consequence of American revolution.

It is thus rightly called the *MOTHER OF ALL REVOLUTIONS *because it had triggered a number of revolutions including French revolution, Spanish Revolutions, revolutions in Latin America and many around the wold.
